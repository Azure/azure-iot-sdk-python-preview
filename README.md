# Azure IoT Hub Python SDKs v2 - PREVIEW

This repository contains the code for the future v2.0.0 of the Azure IoT SDKs for Python. The goal of v2.0.0 is to be a complete rewrite of the existing SDK that maximizes the use of the Python language and its standard features rather than wrap over the C SDK, like v1.x.x of the SDK did.

**Note that these SDKs are currently in preview, and are subject to change.**

# SDKs

This repository contains the following SDKs:

* [Azure IoT Device SDK](azure-iot-device) - /azure-iot-device
    * Provision a device using the Device Provisioning Service for use with the Azure IoT Hub
    * Send/receive telemetry between a device and the Azure IoT Hub
    * Handle direct methods invoked by the Azure IoT Hub on a device

* Azure IoT Hub SDK **(COMING SOON)**
    * Do service/management operations on the Azure IoT Hub

* Azure IoT Hub Provisioning SDK **(COMING SOON)**
    * Do service/management operations on the Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service
