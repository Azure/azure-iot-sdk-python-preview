class PipelineStage(object):
    """
    Base class representing a stage in the processing pipeline.  Each stage is responsible for receiving
    PipelineOperation objects from the top, possibly processing them, and possibly passing them down.  It
    is also responsible for receiving PipelineEvent objects from the bottom, possibly processing them, and
    possibly passing them up.

    Each PipelineStage in the pipeline, is expected to act on some well-defined set of PipelineOperation
    types and/or some set of PipelineEvent types.  If any stage does not act on an operation or event, it
    should pass it to the next stage (for operations) or the previous stage (for events).  In this way, the
    pipeline implements the "chain of responsibility" design pattern (Gamma, et.al. "Design Patterns".
    Addison Wesley. 1995), with each stage being responsible for implementing some "rule" or "policy" of the
    pipeline, and each stage being ignorant of the stages that are before or after it in the pipeline.

    Each stage in the pipeline should act on the smallest set of rules possible, thus making stages small
    and easily testable.  Complex logic should be the exception and not the rule, and complex stages should
    operate on the most generic type of operation possible, thus allowing us to re-use complex logic for
    multiple cases.  The best way to do this is with "converter" stages that convert a specific operation to
    a more general one and with other converter stages that convert general operations to more specific ones.

    An example of a specific-to-generic stage is UseSkAuthProviderStage which takes a specific operation
    (use an auth provider) and converts it into something more generic (here is your device_id, etc, and use
    this SAS token when connecting).

    An example of a generic-to-specific stage is IoTHubMQTTConverterStage which converts IoTHub operations
    (such as SendD2CMessageOperation) to MQTT operations (such as Publish).

    Each stage should also work in the broadest domain possible.  For example a generic stage (say
    "EnsureConnectionStage") that initiates a connection if any arbitrary operation needs a connection is more useful
    than having some MQTT-specific code that re-connects to the MQTT broker if the user calls Publish and
    there's no connection.

    One way to think about stages is to look at every "block of functionality" in your code and ask yourself
    "is this the one and only time I will need this code"?  If the answer is no, it might be worthwhile to
    implement that code in it's own stage in a very generic way.
