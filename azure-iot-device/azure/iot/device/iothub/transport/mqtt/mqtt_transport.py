"""
A note on names, design, and code flow:

This transport is a state machine which is responsible for coordinating
several different things.  (I would like to say that it coordinates several
events, but the word "event" is very overloaded, especially in this context,
so I hesitate to add one more overload).

In particular, it needs to coordinate external things:
    1. Things the caller wants to do, such as "connect", "send message", etc.
    2. Calls into the transport provider
    3. Completion callbacks from the transport provider.
    4. Completion callbacks from this object into the caller.

and also internal things:
    5. The "state" of transport (connected, disconnected, etc).
    6. Transitions between possible states.

Since one caller-initiated action results in many different things happening, this
class uses the following conventions:

1. Actions that the caller can initiate are all named without an underscore at the beginning,
    such as "connect", "send_message", etc.

2. All internal functions are prefixed with an underscore.  This is "the pythonic way", but it bears repeating.
    Internal functions are internal and should be called by external code.

2. Actions will typically trigger a state machine event.  State machine triggers, wihch may
    or may not change state, are all prefixed with _trig_ (_trig_connect, _trig_add_pending_action_to_queue, etc)
    The "_trig" indicates that this is a operation on the state machine.  _trig_* functions are also unusual in
    that they get added to the transport object at runtime when intiializing the Machine object.

3. Functions which call into the provider are prefixed with "_call_provider_", such as _call_provider_connect.
    These are always called as part of state machine transitions.  Calls from the caller should not go directly into the
    provider without going through the state machine.

4. When the provider completes an action or receives an acknowledgement, it will call back into this object using
    functions which are all prefixed with "_on_provider_", such as "_on_provider_connect_complete".  These callback functions
    will, most of the time, trigger additional state machine transitions by calling _trig_ functions.

5. Functions which are called by the state machine as side-effects of state transitions will accept event_data objects
    as the second parameter (after self).  The event_data structure contains information about the trigger or the transition
    which caused the side-effect.

6. Callbacks from this object into caller code, when not passed in as `callback` parameters to function calls, are prefixed with
    on_ (with no underscore), such as "on_transport_connected'.  Because most callbacks are passed in as function parameters,
    there are very few callbacks like this.
