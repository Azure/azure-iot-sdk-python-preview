    """
    PipelineStage which handles operations on a Shared Key security client
    or a X509 certificate driven security client

    This stage handles SetX509SecurityClientOperation and SetSymmetricKeySecurityClientOperation operations.
    For the SetX509SecurityClientOperation it retrieves string into it's constituent parts and generates a sas token to pass down.
    It uses SetSecurityClientArgsOperation to pass the connection string args and the ca_cert
    from the Security Client, and it uses SetSasToken to pass down the
    generated sas token.  After passing down the args and the sas token, this stage
    completes the SetSymmetricKeySecurityClientOperation operation.

    For the SetX509SecurityClientOperation it uses SetSecurityClientArgsOperation to pass the connection string args and the ca_cert
    from the Security Client, and it uses SetClientAuthenticationCertificate to pass down the certificate. After passing
    down the args and the certificate token, this stage completes the SetX509SecurityClientOperation operation.

    All other operations are passed down.
